# Text Summarization using Sequence-to-Sequence Models

This project demonstrates building an abstractive text summarization model using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) approach with attention mechanism. 

## Description:
- The encoder reads the input text and outputs its LSTM states.
- The decoder reads the encoder's output along with the target sequences to produce the summary.
- Attention mechanism helps the model to focus on different parts of the encoder's outputs while generating the summary.

## Requirements:
- tensorflow>=2.0

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have TensorFlow 2.x installed.
2. Run the provided code. Note that the code contains dummy data for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, use a comprehensive dataset like the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.
3. Save the model using the in-built save function.
4. To deploy, the trained model can be used to generate summaries for long texts.

**Note**: This is a basic Seq2Seq model for demonstration. A complete project would need more comprehensive preprocessing, better tokenization, and hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.
