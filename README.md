# Text-Summarization-using-Sequence-to-Sequence-Models
Text summarization is the process of shortening long pieces of text while retaining the core information. Here, we will demonstrate the basic structure for building an abstractive text summarization model using Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models with attention mechanism
